          <h1>Python Pizza</h1>
          <p>
            <b>Python Pizza</b> is a micro conference organized by the Python
            Hamburg Community.
          </p>
          <p>
            We bring the Python Community together for some amazing original
            Pizzaâ„¢ and Python Talks.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe in and encourage practical sessions, in which developers
            share their experience and lessons from real-world projects, each
            talk is 10 mins long.
          </p>
          <p>Thanks to the Python Pizza (Naples!) that started this format!</p>
